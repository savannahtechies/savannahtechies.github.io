The Google Pixel is well from Google, its has earned its aclaims as one of the best photo taking phones, argurably better than iPhone or Samsung, The pixel is divided into two major categories

## Pixel 
The pixel flagships which have the typical 6.3 inch OLED or AMOLED displays, excelent cameras the build varies a lot but now they have stuck to the aluminium fram and glass backs, it has an onscreen optical fingerprint sensor, they use their own set of chips which are the tensore chips, though they started using their own chips from the Pixel 6, it comes with stock android cause well its from Google

## Pixel Pro
The pro model has a larger screen about 6.7 inches of clean display with a refresh rate of about 120Hz, again quality camera with additional features like the telephoto lens, better sensors and also computational photography the rest are almost the same.

## Pixel a
The pixel a series is the more affordable phone that is it is about half the price and almost all the feautres, again almost not all, just almost, so its still a good phone

No one knows what the 'a' stands for but the popular opinion is it stands for affordable.
