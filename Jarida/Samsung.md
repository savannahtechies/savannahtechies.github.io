# Samsung

[[toc]]

So the first one that we start of with is **Samsung**, everyone knows Samsung, unless maybe you've been living under a rock. So Samsung is generally categorized into 6 series, well one is dead now so lets say 5, but I will still give you the bonus.


## S Series
We will start from the top **the S series**

This is their flagship series, the S stands for Super Smart, this is their high end phone it has all the bells and whistles, they are the devices to have cause it has everything you want, you want a clean and clear screen its got you, you want a good camera it has the best in the Samsung line up, the processors, best designs, all of it even the material, its all premium

Under the S series it is further, divided into four, (this started in the 20 series.

*The base S* which is small and fits in the hand really nice, but hmmm funny enough it is not easy to comeby its accessories like cases, screen protectors etc cause usually most phones these days have screens larger than the average of this phone which is about 6.1 inches

*The S plus* which is just a bigger base S with a bigger screen and battery usually it has the same everything, its just bigger usually the screen average is about 6.7 inches and this usually  the size that most people prefer and thus making it easy to get their accessories

*The S Ultra* which sounds funny but is the high end of the high ends, that is it has some little bit more, like additional cameras, these days its gets an S pen which is their stylus, it usually has a different shape so that it can be differentiated with the others

*The S FE* the FE stand for fan edition will its a watered down S Plus and it is always value for the money you basically get the S features for a cheaper price, granted it may lack the camera, screen may not be the same, processor may not be the same but still you have the S badge.

## Z Series

The Z series is also a premium phone, it just folds

The Z series comes in two different variations the Fold series and the flip series

*The Z Fold* is majorly for those that feel as though their current screen real estate isn't enough and they need more hmmm I wonder why they didn't put this under their tab series and call it the Tab Z flip, anyway so it opens like a book making it a tab and when you close it it goes back to being a phone

*The Z flip* it is well... the few who remember the flip phones know why they came up with that idea, flipping was awesome take out a phone and tah it opens some one makes you mad on the phone you tah just close it and you had hang up anyway the acutall people who would love this phone are those with some shallow pockets, looking at you companies that make jeans for women cause why are their pockets that shallow, anyway for those with small pockets and those guys who want to maybe save on space while packing or something of that sort

The Z doesn't stand for anything by the way

## A Series

The A Series, the A stands for Alpha, it is aimed at the mid-range market, it is supposed to provide a balance of performance and affordability, some may have premium features some may completely lack those features.

Simply put the naming is easy so the higher the number the closer to the Flagship and premium features so it might have gotten some, like that saying that goes fly close to the sun you get burnt, well some of these have been burned anyway I feel like there's a better saying that would be used, if you are on a budget then this is the series for you,

well the variations are as follows

A0[number]

A0[number]S

A1[number]

A2[number]

A3[number]

A5[number]

## M Series

The M I kid you not stands for Millenial ei it not me talk to Samsung, 

The M series is more focused on the battery life, so performance wise don't expect much but if you are going for hiking, you can get this phone cause it will last, it basically just has the essential features and a pocket friendly price tag.

So if you prioritize battery life over anything this is the series for you its variations are similar to the A series but lacks the 0 and 2 variation

## F Series

The F stands for Fun very original I know

The F series focuses on entertainment, so good camera setups and larger displays probably enhanced media consumption, well there's nothing really alot to write about it but you get the gist so for those that are entertainment oriented [not games] will be  pleased to have these phones

its variations are similar to the M series.
